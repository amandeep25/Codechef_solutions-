<h2>This notebook demonstrates image to image translation using conditional GAN's, as described in Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks.</h2>
<h3>Using this technique we can colorize black and white photos, convert google maps to google earth, etc. Here, we convert building facades to real buildings.</h3>
